## 🖱️ Anti-AFK AutoClicker for Online Infiltration Games

This project provides a simple yet effective **AutoClicker** designed to bypass Anti-AFK (Away From Keyboard) systems in online games, especially those requiring long waiting periods (such as looting or event queues) which might lead to disconnection due to inactivity (e.g., in games like *Sea of Thieves* - SOT).
